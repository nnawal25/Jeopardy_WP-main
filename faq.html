    <label for="faq1" class="question">WHAT IS THE PROCESS TO BECOME A CONTESTANT?
</label>
    <div class="answer">
      First, you must take and pass the Jeopardy! Test. If you pass the test and meet the minimum eligibility requirements, you will be placed into a random selection process for an invitation to an audition. Assuming you perform well at the audition, you will be placed into the contestant pool and could be invited to compete up to 18 months from your audition date. Making it to an audition is not a guarantee of being invited to compete on the show.

The same process applies to teens and college students, with each test specific to the next scheduled tournament only.

    <label for="faq3" class="question">WHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ANYTIME TEST AND THE SCHEDULED JEOPARDY! TEST?</label>
    <div class="answer">
      The differences between the Anytime Test and the scheduled Jeopardy! Test are as follows:

<p>The Anytime Test is available to take at any time, while scheduled Jeopardy! Test events are held periodically on a specified date and time, and users must be registered in advance.</p>

<p>The Anytime Test can begin as soon as you complete login and registration, whereas registration for the scheduled Jeopardy! Test must be completed at least an hour before the test’s start time.</p> 

<p>For both the Jeopardy! Test and the Anytime Test, applicants may only submit one test per year. Multiple attempts could result in disqualification.</p>

<p>There is no difference in format between the scheduled Jeopardy! Test and the Anytime Test.</p>

    <label for="faq4" class="question">CAN I TAKE THE ANYTIME TEST IF I TOOK THE SCHEDULED JEOPARDY! TEST?</label>
    <div class="answer">
      Yes! Taking the Anytime Test is an additional chance to qualify to be on Jeopardy!, even for those who have already taken a scheduled Jeopardy! Test.

    <input type="checkbox" id="faq5" class="question">
    <label for="faq5" class="question">CAN I TAKE THE ANYTIME TEST MORE THAN ONCE?</label>
    <div class="answer">
You are able to submit one Anytime Test per one-year period, and you have a limited number of attempts to submit a test during the test-taking period. If another Anytime Test period arises, you can submit one if it has been more than 365 days since the last time you submitted an Anytime Test.

<p>If a scheduled Jeopardy! Test occurs within that one-year period, you may take that test as well.</p>

    <label for="faq7" class="question">WHAT CAN I EXPECT IF I’M SELECTED TO AUDITION?</label>
    <div class="answer">
     Auditions are currently taking place in two parts via video conference. In the first round, qualifiers will take a 50-question “in-person” online test (in the same format as the Jeopardy! Test). You may be contacted anytime within a year of taking this test (if you pass and are randomly selected) to participate in the gameplay audition round.

In the audition, contestant coordinators will lead the group through a brief game-playing tutorial. After the tutorial, everyone will take turns playing a mock version of the game in groups of three. At the end of the mock game, each applicant will be asked to tell a little bit about themselves: likes, dislikes, career, family, hobbies, etc. The audition will last approximately one hour. (Note that you must submit your signed application at least one day before your audition date.)

Reliable internet access and a computer webcam or front-facing camera on your phone or tablet are required for the audition. You will receive an email with a Zoom video conference link approximately 30 minutes prior to the audition, which you should join at the appointed time. We suggest using a laptop for the audition, but you can also use a phone or tablet (note that you will need the Zoom app installed on your phone or tablet if you plan on using either of those).

    <input type="checkbox" id="faq8" class="question">
    <label for="faq8" class="question">IS THERE A FEE TO TAKE THE JEOPARDY! TEST?</label>
    <div class="answer">
There is no fee to take any of the tests, but any costs you incur in connection with the test are your responsibility. Likewise, if you are invited to participate in an in-person audition, all costs (including, but not limited to, accommodations, meals, transportation and parking) must come at your own expense.
