Jeopardy! is a popular American television game show that has been on the air since 1964. It features a quiz competition where contestants answer clues in the form of answers, and the correct response must be given in the form of a question. The show is known for its broad range of categories, including history, literature, science, pop culture, and more.

To play Jeopardy!, here's a basic breakdown of the rules:

1. Format: The game consists of three rounds: Jeopardy!, Double Jeopardy!, and Final Jeopardy!

2. Contestants: Three contestants participate in each episode.

3. Clue Selection: A game board is displayed with different categories and dollar amounts. Each clue is assigned a value ranging from low to high. The contestants take turns selecting clues by calling out the category and dollar amount.

4. Responses: The host reads the clue aloud, and the contestants have to respond with the corresponding question in a specific format. For example, if the clue is "This is the capital of France," the correct response would be "What is Paris?"

5. Wagering: In the first two rounds (Jeopardy! and Double Jeopardy!), contestants can wager any amount of money they have accumulated on the clue they select in the Daily Double. This is a special clue where only the contestant who chose it can respond and can potentially double their money.

6. Daily Double: When a contestant uncovers a Daily Double clue, they can wager any amount of their current winnings but must do so before seeing the clue. If they answer correctly, they win the wagered amount. If they answer incorrectly, they lose that amount.

7. Final Jeopardy!: At the end of the Double Jeopardy! round, the contestants are shown a category for the Final Jeopardy! clue but do not see the clue itself. They then have to wager a portion of their winnings on the clue before seeing it. After the wagers are made, the clue is revealed, and the contestants write their responses. Once all responses are submitted, they are revealed, and correct answers are awarded the wagered amount. The contestant with the highest total winnings at the end of the game is declared the winner.




WHAT IS THE PROCESS TO BECOME A CONTESTANT?
Answer: First, you must take and pass the Jeopardy! Test. If you pass the test and meet the minimum eligibility requirements, you will be placed into a random selection process for an invitation to an audition. Assuming you perform well at the audition, you will be placed into the contestant pool and could be invited to compete up to 18 months from your audition date. Making it to an audition is not a guarantee of being invited to compete on the show.

The same process applies to teens and college students, with each test specific to the next scheduled tournament only.



WHAT ARE THE MINIMUM ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS?
Answer: Applicants must meet the following requirements to meet basic eligibility:

Must be over 18 (except for the Teen Tournament).
For the Teen Tournament, must be between the ages of 13 and 17 at the time of taping.
